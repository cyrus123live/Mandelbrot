# Mandelbrot

Made in 2020

Simply compile each file, and then run Main to simulate the mandelbrot set! Very proud of this program, there are a selection of colours to choose from, as well as a save image button which allows you to save a 10k by 10k pixel image of the specific part of the mandelbrot set you are currently looking at.
